# Test Plan — SportSystems (Sample)

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the test strategy, scope, and approach for validating core modules of the SportSystems web application. The objective is to assure functional correctness, usability, performance, and integration quality across environments.

## 2. Scope
- In scope: Authentication, Event Management, Ticketing, Reporting dashboards
- Out of scope: Native mobile apps, third‑party vendor UIs not owned by SportSystems

## 3. Test Types
- Functional (happy path, edge cases, negative)
- UI/UX validation against design system
- Regression and smoke suites
- API testing (REST)
- Integration testing across services
- Performance (baseline using JMeter for critical endpoints)

## 4. Environments
- DEV: feature validation
- QA: regression and integration
- STAGE: pre‑prod sign‑off

## 5. Entry / Exit Criteria
- Entry: Stable build, test data available, services up, blockers < P1
- Exit: All P0/P1 defects closed; P2 with workarounds and product sign‑off; automated suites green

## 6. Test Data
- Synthetic user accounts with roles: Admin, Manager, Viewer
- Sample events with varying capacities and schedules

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- Flaky selectors → Use data‑testids and contract tests; page objects
- Env instability → Health checks and retries with backoff
- Integration changes → Contract mocks and consumer‑driven tests

## 8. Reporting
- Daily dashboard via CI
- Defects tracked in Jira with reproducible steps and screenshots/videos

## 9. Automation Strategy
- Playwright + Cucumber for E2E flows with tags: @smoke, @regression, @critical
- Parallel workers; shard by feature; retry only failed specs

## 10. Traceability
- Map requirements → features → scenarios → test runs in CI

## 11. Sign‑off
